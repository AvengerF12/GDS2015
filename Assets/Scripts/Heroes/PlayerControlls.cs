	//created Player controler concept


	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {

	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {

        

		//if Gyroscope is tiled forward
			//spawn horde of waves forward
		//if Gyroscope is tilted right
			//spawn horde of waves right
		//if Gyroscope is tilted left
			//spawn horde of waves left
		//if Gyroscope is tilted backwards
			//spawn horde of waves backwards






		//!!Possible Concepts!!

		//if Gyroscope is "flapped" like a fan then enemies are sent backwards by a gust of wind
		//this would be on quite a significant cooldown but would be a exciting concept for
		//the player to toy with


		//!!traps!!

		//if player clicks a part of the screen then the detection code will locate
		//where the player clicked. The code will then locate a sufficient area to
		//place the trap (on the nearest tile) and will ask the player for a 
		//option to ask if they are sure they want to place the trap.


		//!!Build Phase!!

		//possbility on a build phase instead of placing traps real time.
